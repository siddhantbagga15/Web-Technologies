A larger-than-life symbol of the entertainment business, Hollywood beckons tourists with landmarks like TCL Chinese Theatre and star-studded Walk of Fame. Many tourists come to Hollywood to see all of these things. Because of the importance of Hollywood in the movie industry of the United States, the whole industry is often called \"Hollywood\", even though not all movies are made in Hollywood."

Los Angeles may possibly be the American city with the best overall variety of local beaches. There are a wide range of beaches within the large confines of Los Angeles County, and the county also neighbors miles and miles of other beach cities, spreading both north and south of LA. Families may enjoy large beaches like Santa Monica or Redondo Beach, with a wide range of facilities, retail areas, and amenities, while adventurers may like more secluded beaches like those found in Malibu or Palos Verdes."
